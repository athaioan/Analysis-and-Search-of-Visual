# Analysis-and-Search-of-Visual

Projects' implementation in the context of the Analysis and Search of Visual Data course. 

The provided code was written by me, while the reports were written jointly by me and Aleix Espu√±a Fontcuberta. 

Warning: Please note that the course's examiners make use of code and text similarity software and thus you should refrain from copying code and report segments. Afterall, the purpose of conducting the projects is for you to learn while working on them.
